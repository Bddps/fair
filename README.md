# Intro

Fairlayer is a billion+ transaction per second payment network secured with blockchain. It implements the idea of Extended Lightning Network [XLN](https://medium.com/fairlayer/xln-extended-lightning-network-80fa7acf80f3).

Each user of the network runs a full node that processes few publicly broadcasted onchain transactions (insurance rebalances, disputes etc). All the payments happen instantly peer-to-peer offchain and can be enforced in onchain "court" when needed.

Imagine that your bank always gives you a signed proof that you own $X and you are always guaranteed to go to public independent blockchain court to enforce them to return you $X back which you later could deposit to another bank.
