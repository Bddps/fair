# Intro

Fairlayer is a billion+ transaction per second payment network secured with blockchain. It implements the idea of Extended Lightning Network [XLN](https://medium.com/fairlayer/xln-extended-lightning-network-80fa7acf80f3).

Each user of the network runs a full node that processes few publicly broadcasted onchain transactions (insurance rebalances, disputes etc). All the payments happen instantly offchain and can be enforced in onchain "court" when needed.

Imagine, that your bank always gives you a signed proof that you own $X and you are always guaranteed to enforce this proof on the public blockchain court and return you $X back, which you later can deposit to other banks.
