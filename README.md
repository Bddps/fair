# Intro

Fairlayer is a billion+ transaction per second payment network secured with blockchain. It implements the idea of Extended Lightning Network [XLN](https://medium.com/fairlayer/xln-extended-lightning-network-80fa7acf80f3).

Each user of the network runs a full node that processes few publicly broadcasted onchain transactions (insurance rebalances, disputes etc). All the payments happen instantly offchain and can be enforced in onchain "court" when needed.
