<p>Failsafe is a network of bidirectional state channels between users and hubs. We've took the Lightning Network, fixed their capacity/liquidity issues with temporarily promised "uninsured" balances and implemented layer 2 functionality natively in layer 1 itself, tailoring both to each other and dramatically reducing the complexity of off-chain protocol.</p>

<p>At first glance our hubs look similarly to traditional banking system and the Internet's hub-and-spoke topology. But unlike trusted, custodian and opaque banks all the relationships between users and hubs are cross-signed and enforceable on a public blockchain "court", which makes the assets actually ownable yet instantly transferable towards anyone off-chain through the network of channels eg <b>Alice-HubEU-Bob or Alice-HubEU-HubUS-Carol</b>.</p>

<p>The blockchain layer is rarely touched and used purely as "arbiter with memory", storing the insurances. With use of uninsured balances we even can cover users who cannot afford blockchain layer fees (the 50% of population lives on $2/day) - which makes Failsafe scalable for all value transfers on Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Lightweight Node</strong>. Our verifying full-node <b>is built to routinely run on laptops, mobile phones and even smart watches</b> without any inconvenience for the end user. The node processes very few rebalancing transactions and doesn't require significant resources unlike full nodes of other blockchains.</p>

<p><strong>Trust-less</strong>. All digital assets in user wallets possess the same qualities as golden bars, physical cash and Bitcoin - they are ownable, non-custodian and censorship-resistant. Even in transit we use hashlocks to make the sequence of payments atomic: they execute all or none at all.</p>

<p><strong>Scalable</strong>. Failsafe hubs operate independently from each other and only share common settlement layer: the system is has nearly no cap on scalability: 1,000,000+ transactions per second off-chain require just a few rebalance transactions per second on-chain.</p>

<p><strong>Lowest Fees</strong>. Forget ridiculous 2-4% of Visa and Paypal. All Failsafe hubs charge <b>0.1% with no hidden fees</b>, thanks to lack of fraud by design, lower number of round trips and no compliancy burden. Unlike archaic credit card credentials "secured" by SMS one-time-codes, Failsafe uses strong client-side cryptography where payment signature simply cannot be forged without compromising user's device.</p>

<p><strong>Decentralized</strong>. There's no central server and central point of failure in Failsafe. The hubs are non-custodian and Failsafe provide ways to limit risks (associated with "uninsured" balances to negligible level. Blockchain as arbiter will always be on your side.</p>

<p><strong>Multiasset</strong>. Failsafe supports not just currencies but any numerical assets: stock, utility tokens, voting shares, securities. There's on-chain moderation process to avoid unnecessary bloat, but other than that tokens can serve different purposes and be very configurable.</p>
