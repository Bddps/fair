<p>All "scalable" blockchains up until now were simply about increasing blocksize or changing the way transactions are ordered and confirmed. It destroys the underlying security principles of blockchain and its decentralization for the sake of a little bit higher on-chain tps.</p>

<p>Failsafe is the first blockchain ever to go entirely "off-chain" out of box: where each participant routinely remains a fully-verifying node with no dependance on Simple Payment Verification / light-clients.</p>

<p>More than that, when bloated fake blockchains claim something like 100,000 tps under ridiculous testing conditions (few heavily centralized datacenters interconnected with Gigabit link) Failsafe can <b>routinely support millions of tps and scale pretty much infinitely</b>. Our goal is to never compromise on safety and correctness of the first settlement layer and <b>have all laptops and mobile phones as full nodes</b>.</p>

<p><strong>Superset of Lightning Network</strong>. In a way, Failsafe is just an extended version of LN. We've fixed <a href="http://lightning.network/">Lightning's</a> capacity/liquidity issues with uninsured balances, and implemented layer 2 functionality natively in layer 1 itself, tailoring both to each other to reducing the complexity of off-chain interactions.</p>

<p><strong>True Blockchain</strong>. Our verifying full-node <b>is built to routinely run on consumer hardware: laptops and mobile phones</b> without any inconvenience for the end user. The node is restricted at 1 Gb of disk space and 50 Mb of data to download per day. The node processes very few rebalancing transactions which doesn't require significant resources unlike full nodes of other blockchains.</p>

<p><strong>True Scalability</strong>. Failsafe hubs operate independently from each other and only share common settlement layer: the system is has nearly no cap on scalability: 1M transactions per second off-chain require just a few rebalance transactions on-chain. Payments are instant and do not require on-chain confirmations.</p>

<p><strong>True Decentralization</strong>. Our consensus of choice is Tendermint with identities-based Proof-of-Stake. Shares are distributed to public identities 1-for-1 which provides highest decentralization index - <a href="https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e">Nakomoto coefficient</a>. It takes to compromise 34 entities to hijack this blockchain vs just 3 mining pools in Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>
