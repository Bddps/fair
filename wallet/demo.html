    <p>This is how LN is hoping to work, but as we've visually demonstrated, <b>none of that makes any sense.</b> Creditors have no incentive to risk their assets for nothing. Hubs have no incentive to risk collateral and open channels to unverified users. Users have no incentive to open channels to anyone else but most connected nodes (hubs, yes). Providing collateral on-chain beforehand requires a ton of guessing and unnecessary on-chain transactions, making it too expensive.</p>

<div style="font-size:24px; padding:40px" id=info>This is a dead simple and, hopefully, obvious visual demonstration of payment channels. We'll show how LN works, demonstrate the liquidity problem and propose a simple solution to it. Below every user you will see their global on-chain balance (Alice, Bob, Carol and Hub have 15 coins each, creditor has 20). Moving those is slow as it requires public broadcast, so let's create a payment channel.</div>
